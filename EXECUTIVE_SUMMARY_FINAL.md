## 🏆 WHY THIS WILL WORK

### Your Unfair Advantages
1. **2M Followers** = Instant distribution ($500K value in ads)
2. **Polyglot Authority** = Instant trust (users believe you)
3. **Content Creator** = Can market it yourself (daily posts)
4. **Personal Brand** = Product differentiation ("Learn Spanish with @languyofficial")

### Why You Don't Need Co-Founder
- You have distribution (they don't add value there)
- You have vision (you know what users want)
- AI builds features (you don't need their coding)
- Revenue funds contractors (better than equity split)

### Why 85% Is Enough
- Your audience will try it because it's YOU
- Beta users give feedback on what to build next
- Perfect product = wasted time if wrong features
- Ship fast, iterate based on real users
