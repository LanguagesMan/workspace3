# 🎯 START HERE - MCP Configuration Complete

## ✅ What Just Happened

Your Cursor is now configured with **GENIUS-LEVEL auto-detection** for all MCPs. It will **automatically know** when to use each tool based on what you say.

## 🧠 The REAL Working MCPs (All Public)

### Configured Globally (Works in ALL Projects):

| MCP | Package | What It Does | Auto-Triggers |
|-----|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 🧠 **Sequential Thinking** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` | Deep reasoning & planning | "plan", "optimize", "how should", "analyze" |
| 🎭 **Playwright** | `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` | Testing & screenshots | "test", "screenshot", "verify", "mobile" |
| 🤖 **Puppeteer** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer` | Web scraping & research | "scrape", "TikTok", "Instagram", "how does [site]" |
| 🔍 **Brave Search** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search` | Web research | "research", "find", "best practices" |
| 🌐 **Fetch** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch` | API testing | "api", "endpoint", "test api" |
| 📁 **Filesystem** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` | File operations | "find files", "search project" |
| 🐙 **GitHub** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` | PRs & issues | "create pr", "github", "issue" |
| 📝 **Git** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-git` | Git operations | "commit", "branch", "git" |
| 💾 **Memory** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` | Persistent learning | Always active |
| 🐘 **Postgres** | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres` | Database ops | "query", "database", "sql" |

## 🎯 How to Use (SO SIMPLE)

### Just Talk Naturally. That's It.

You **DON'T** need to say MCP names. Just describe what you want:

```
❌ Don't say: "Use Playwright to test the app"
✅ Just say: "Test the app"

❌ Don't say: "Use Puppeteer to scrape TikTok"
✅ Just say: "How does TikTok do scrolling?"

❌ Don't say: "Use sequential-thinking to plan"
✅ Just say: "How should I optimize this?"
```

Cursor **automatically detects** and uses the right MCPs!
