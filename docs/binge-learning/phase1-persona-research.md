# Phase 1 · Foundations — Beginner Persona Research

## Target Beginner Segments

1. **Curious Scrollers**  
   - Profile: Ages 16-28, heavy short-form video consumers, low commitment history.  
   - Motivation: Discover fun, visual knowledge without feeling like school.  
   - Barriers: Short attention span, skepticism toward "courses", fear of boredom.

2. **Career Pivoters**  
   - Profile: Ages 25-40, juggling jobs or family, eager to reskill quickly.  
   - Motivation: Needs practical, job-aligned outcomes with light-weight guidance.  
   - Barriers: Time scarcity, overwhelm, anxiety about starting “from zero”.

3. **Global Self-Improvers**  
   - Profile: Ages 18-35, outside primary language markets, motivated by subtitled binge content.  
   - Motivation: Wants entertaining, culturally relevant input with language scaffolds.  
   - Barriers: Limited localized resources, confidence gap, data/bandwidth constraints.

4. **Habit Hackers**  
   - Profile: Ages 20-45, previously tried learning apps, chasing dopamine loops.  
   - Motivation: Looking for an experience that feels like games + streaming.  
   - Barriers: Burnout from streak pressure, lack of novelty, stale content.

## Core Beginner Learning Jobs-To-Be-Done

- "When I press play, I want bite-sized explanations so I can feel smart fast."  
- "When I binge episodes, I want proof I'm progressing so I stay motivated."  
- "When I hit something hard, I want instant support so I don't quit."  
- "When I come back later, I want my experience to adapt so it never feels repetitive."  
- "When I share progress, I want social proof so my friends join the journey."

## Binge-Friendly Success Metrics

- **Engagement Loop Metrics**: 70%+ of learners complete at least video+quiz per session, 40% chain 3+ episodes, median session length ≥ 12 minutes.  
- **Beginner Confidence Score**: Self-reported "I can do this" ≥ 4/5 after each episode.  
- **Progress Velocity**: Average XP gain per binge hour and milestone unlock rate week-over-week.  
- **Retention Signals**: D1 retention ≥ 45%, D7 ≥ 25% for novice cohorts.  
- **Social Amplification**: % of episodes shared or quests completed with friends ≥ 15%.

## Research Inputs Needed

- Qualitative interviews per persona (n=10 each) focusing on binge media habits.  
- Watch-time analytics from MVP (drop-offs, replays) segmented by cohort.  
- Competitive teardowns: Netflix-style education platforms, Duolingo, Brilliant, YouTube Ed binge lists.  
- App telemetry for session frequency, XP accrual, quiz win/loss, streak longevity.

## Open Questions to Validate

- What push/pull triggers drive a second binge session in first 48 hours?  
- How far can we stretch episode length before dropout rises?  
- Which reward themes resonate (narrative arcs vs. currency vs. cosmetic loot)?  
- What is the optimal difficulty ramp for complete beginners to avoid frustration?  
- How does mobile-only usage impact ability to take quizzes or notes mid-video?
