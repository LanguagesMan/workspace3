# Phase 2 · Core Binge Loop Design

## Experience Flow (Watch → Interact → Reward → Tease)

1. **Pre-Episode Tease**  
   - Auto-plays a 5-second cold open trailer featuring highlights and the cliffhanger payoff.  
   - Shows personalized XP preview and the next collectible fragment to hook anticipation.

2. **Immersive Episode Play**  
   - Vertical, mobile-first video (3-5 minutes) with UI-free playback until learning cue occurs.  
   - Chapter markers reveal optional "tap for context" overlays, preserving binge momentum.

3. **Micro-Interaction Injection**  
   - Dynamic lower-third prompt pauses video with delightful animation after key concept.  
   - Learners answer 1-2 tap-based micro-questions (multiple choice, swipe-to-sort).  
   - Correct answers trigger instant feedback; incorrect paths play a 10-second clarify clip.

4. **Instant Reward Burst**  
   - XP scorecard and streak meter pop-in with haptic tick.  
   - Unlock mini-loot (cards, stickers) tied to episode theme; show completion badge filling up.  
   - Offer optional "Double XP" by completing a rapid-fire bonus challenge (<30 seconds).

5. **Next-Episode Teaser**  
   - Autoplay teaser with narrative or challenge hook within 3 seconds.  
   - Display upcoming loot preview and progress bar toward chapter milestone.  
   - Provide quick choice: "Play next" (default), "Queue for later", or "Explore path" (branching).

## Loop Variation for Beginners

- **Episode Length Adaptation**: Start with 2-minute clips, expanding as completion rate stays ≥80%.  
- **Adaptive Pause Frequency**: Increase micro-interaction cadence when confusion signals spike (wrong answers, replays).  
- **Checkpoints**: After every 3 episodes, offer reflection moments ("What stuck?") to convert binge energy into retention.  
- **Energy Meter**: Introduce soft energy gauge to encourage healthy breaks without punitive cooldowns.

## Reward Economy Integration

- Base XP: 50 XP per episode completion, with streak multipliers up to 3×.  
- Bonus XP: 10 XP per perfect micro-quiz, +25 XP for completing bonus challenge.  
- Loot Table: Weighted toward narrative collectibles early, shift to power-ups (hints, skips) after onboarding.  
- Binge Stamps: Track binge sessions; 5 stamps unlock seasonal cosmetic.

## Teaser & Notification Strategy

- Post-episode: Show "Next up in 15s" countdown; learners can swipe to preview alternate learning path.  
- Off-platform: Smart notifications after 3 hours idle summarizing what reward awaits.  
- Weekly trailers: Curated binge playlists with theme (e.g., "Crash course weekend"), accessible from dashboard.

## Success Criteria for Loop

- ≥70% conversion from episode to micro-interaction completion.  
- ≥60% of users accept auto-play within 5 seconds.  
- Reward claim rate ≥85% (avoid unclaimed currency hoarding).  
- ≥30% of sessions trigger optional bonus challenge.  
- Average binge chain length ≥3 episodes for beginner cohorts.
