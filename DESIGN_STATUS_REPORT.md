# 🎨 Design Status Report

## ✅ Completed Fixes

1. **Bottom-left controls** - Repositioned speed (1x) and translation (EN) buttons to bottom-left
2. **Quiz button** - Moved to bottom-left, simplified to "?" character
3. **No borders on left buttons** - Removed outlines from playback controls
4. **Right sidebar buttons** - Removed borders, added dark background with blur
5. **Word translations** - Now showing "palabra = word" format immediately
6. **Top bar simplified** - Shows only: 🔥 Streak, ⭐ XP, 📚 Words

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

1. **Cyan question mark** - Still shows as bright cyan (#00F5FF), needs to be white/minimalist
2. **Duplicate stat overlays** - Old stat cards still appearing on top of videos
3. **Control positioning** - Need to verify all controls are thumb-accessible

## 📊 Current Design Score: 7.5/10

**To achieve 10/10:**
- Remove all cyan colors → use white/black only
- Remove duplicate UI elements
- Ensure thumb-reach for all controls (bottom 30% of screen)
- Match TikTok's minimalist aesthetic

## Next Steps

1. Find and fix cyan help button color
2. Remove duplicate stat box overlays
3. Final Playwright test with 3 user personas
4. Screenshot comparison with TikTok
