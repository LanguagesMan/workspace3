# 🚨 URGENT: BUILD THE COMPLETE UNIFIED FEED

## What User Sees Now:
❌ Just "Loading videos..." - broken, incomplete
❌ 36 scattered HTML files - confusing mess
❌ No level adaptation, no transcripts, no feed

## What User NEEDS (Build This NOW):

### THE COMPLETE FEED (ONE index.html file):

**1. INFINITE SCROLL FEED** (Like TikTok + Instagram combined)
- Videos section (TikTok-style vertical scroll)
- News articles section (CNN-style cards)
- Stories section (Instagram-style circles at top)
- Mix all content types in ONE endless feed

**2. LEVEL ADAPTATION** (Critical!)
- User picks level: A1 (beginner) → C2 (fluent)
- Feed shows ONLY content matching their level
- A1: "El gato es bonito" (simple)
- C2: "La infraestructura económica" (advanced)

**3. TRANSCRIPTS + WORD TRANSLATION**
- Every video has Spanish subtitles
- Click ANY word → instant English translation
- Save to unified database
- Track which words user knows

**4. USER STATS BANNER** (Top of page)
- "Day 7 | 450 words learned | 🔥 Streak"
- Shows progress across ALL 6 apps

**5. MUSIC + INTERACTION**
- Videos have background music
- Like/comment/share buttons (TikTok-style)
- Swipe up for next content

## RESEARCH THESE APPS (Steal Their Patterns):

1. **TikTok** - Infinite scroll, video feed, swipe physics
2. **Instagram** - Stories, Reels, engagement
3. **Duolingo** - Level adaptation, streak system
4. **LingoPie** - Click-to-translate in videos
5. **CNN/BBC** - News feed layout

## ACTION PLAN:

1. **DELETE** all 36 HTML files → Clean slate
2. **BUILD** ONE index.html with complete unified feed
3. **RESEARCH** TikTok/Instagram with Firecrawl MCP
4. **TEST** with Playwright --headless
5. **COMMIT** when it actually works

## What Success Looks Like:

User opens http://localhost:3001 and sees:
- ✅ Stats banner at top ("Day 7 | 450 words")
- ✅ Stories row (Instagram-style circles)
- ✅ Infinite feed of mixed content (videos + articles + news)
- ✅ Every video has Spanish subtitles
- ✅ Click any word = instant translation + save
- ✅ Smooth TikTok-style scrolling
- ✅ Level selector (A1/A2/B1/B2/C1/C2)
- ✅ Content matches selected level

**BUILD THIS. NOT 36 FILES. ONE COMPLETE WORKING FEED.**
