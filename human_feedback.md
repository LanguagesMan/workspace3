# WORKSPACE3 - USER'S VISION & FEEDBACK

## 🎯 THE MOST IMPORTANT PROJECT

**This might be the most important project we have.**

## ✅ WHAT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETE

### Core Sections (ALL of these!)
1. **Video/Reels section** - TikTok-style full-screen vertical scroll + clickable word translations
2. **News section** - Language learning news adapted to user's level
3. **Music section** - Songs in target language with lyrics and translations
4. **Stories section** - Interesting stories in the menu

### Integration
- Integrate ALL APIs
- Connect to unified database
- Pull content from ai-feed
- Adapt content to different user levels

## 🎯 MAKE IT ADDICTIVE

- **As addictive as possible**
- Different kinds of content for different people
- Easy to scroll for hours
- Visual, engaging, fun
- Adapt to all kinds of different people

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't focus on sparkly features (popups, achievements, streaks)
- Don't add complexity before core works
- Focus on completing the WHOLE APP first

## ✅ PRIORITY

1. Complete video/reels section (TikTok-style)
2. Add news section
3. Add music section
4. Integrate all APIs
5. Make it work for different user levels
