## 🚀 PRE-LAUNCH PHASE (Days -7 to -1)

### Day -7: First Tease

**Twitter/X:**
```
I've been working on something for 6 months...

It combines:
• TikTok's addictive UX
• AI personalization
• Language learning

And it's almost ready.

Should I share it? 👀
```
**Engagement goal:** 50+ likes, 10+ comments

**Instagram Story:**
- Black screen with white text: "Something big is coming..."
- Emoji: 🎬🇪🇸
- Poll: "Want a sneak peek?" YES/NO

**TikTok:**
- Video: Me coding late at night
- Text overlay: "Building something that will change how you learn Spanish..."
- Hook: "What if learning Spanish was as fun as TikTok?"

---

### Day -6: Sneak Peek #1

**Twitter/X:**
```
Okay fine, here's a sneak peek 👇

This is how you'll learn Spanish:
1. Watch a video
2. Tap any word
3. Get instant translation
4. Save it to your vocabulary

Like TikTok, but you're learning a language.

Launch in 6 days. [GIF demo]
```

**Instagram Post:**
- Video: 15-second demo of tapping words
- Caption: "Learning Spanish just got addictive 🎯 Launch in 6 days"
- Hashtags: #LanguageLearning #Spanish #EdTech #LearnSpanish

**LinkedIn:**
```
After 6 months of development, I'm launching Langflix next week.

The problem: Traditional language apps have 95% drop-off rates.
The solution: Make learning as engaging as TikTok.

Here's what we built: [demo video link]

Launching Tuesday. Thoughts?
```

---

### Day -5: Problem/Solution

**Twitter Thread:**
```
Thread: Why language learning apps fail (and how we fixed it) 🧵

1/ You download Duolingo with big dreams.
   "This year, I'll finally learn Spanish!"
   
2/ Day 1: Fun! Gamified! Addictive!
   Day 7: Repetitive exercises...
   Day 30: You stop opening it.
   
3/ The problem isn't you. It's the app.
   Artificial sentences. Boring drills. No context.
   "The turtle eats apples" ← who says this??
   
4/ Real language learning happens through:
   • Immersion in native content
   • Context-based vocabulary
   • Consistent exposure
   • Actual conversation practice
   
5/ So we built Langflix:
   • 825 real Spanish videos
   • Tap any word for translation
   • AI chat using YOUR vocabulary
   • Spaced repetition that works
   
6/ Like TikTok, but educational.
   Like Duolingo, but actually effective.
   
7/ Launching in 5 days.
   RT if you want early access 🚀
```

**Day 2: Learning Tip #1**

**Twitter/X:**
```
Spanish learning tip:

Don't try to memorize EVERY word.

Focus on:
• Words you'll actually use
• Words that appear repeatedly
• Words that interest YOU

Langflix lets you tap and save only the words you want.

Quality over quantity 🎯
```

**Instagram Post:**
- Graphic: "Learning Tip #1"
- Text overlay with tip
- Caption: "Work smarter, not harder 🧠 #SpanishLearning"

**Day 3: User Spotlight #1**

**Twitter/X:**
```
User spotlight:

Meet Sarah. She tried Duolingo for 6 months. Made zero progress.

Then she tried Langflix.

2 weeks: 87 words learned
3 weeks: First AI conversation
4 weeks: Watching intermediate videos

Her secret? 10 minutes every morning with coffee ☕

[Screenshot of her progress]
```

**Day 4: Behind-the-Scenes**

**Twitter/X:**
```
Behind the scenes:

The hardest part of building Langflix wasn't the code.

It was curating 825 videos that were:
• Engaging enough to watch
• Clear enough to learn from
• Varied enough for all levels

We watched 5,000+ videos. Kept 825.

Quality > quantity.
```

**Instagram Post:**
- Carousel showing video curation process
- Caption: "How we choose the best videos 🎬"

---

**Day 5: Feature Deep Dive - AI Chat**

**Twitter/X Thread:**
```
How Langflix AI chat works (and why it's different): 🧵

1/ Most AI language tutors use generic prompts.
   "Let's talk about the weather"
   "Order food at a restaurant"
   
2/ The problem? You haven't learned those words yet.
   You're just guessing or translating in your head.
   
3/ Langflix is different.
   The AI uses the EXACT words you saved from videos.
   
4/ Example:
   You watched a video about libraries.
   Saved "biblioteca" (library).
   
5/ In your next AI chat:
   AI: "¿Fuiste a la biblioteca ayer?"
   ("Did you go to the library yesterday?")
   
6/ You get to practice words you JUST learned.
   In context. In conversation.
   
7/ This is how language learning should work.
   
8/ Try it free: [link]

### Week 2-4: Ongoing Content Calendar

**Monday: Learning Tip**
```
Tip: Use Spanish subtitles + English subtitles

At first, you'll read English.
Gradually, you'll read Spanish more.
Eventually, you won't need English at all.

Langflix shows both. You train your brain naturally 🧠
