# ⚡ START HERE FIRST - READ BEFORE ANY AGENT!

## 🚨 CRITICAL: READ THESE TWO FILES IN ORDER

### 1. **CRITICAL_PHILOSOPHY_UPDATE.md** ← READ THIS FIRST!
**Why:** Corrects the fundamental app philosophy  
**Key Point:** TikTok FIRST, learning SECOND  
**Impact:** Changes how ALL agents should work  

### 2. **OVERNIGHT_AGENTS_MASTER_INDEX.md** ← READ THIS SECOND
**Why:** Shows execution order and overview  
**Key Point:** How all 8 agents fit together  
**Impact:** Helps you plan the work

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY

**The app is NOT:**
- ❌ Duolingo with videos
- ❌ Educational app that forces learning
- ❌ Requires onboarding before use
- ❌ Blocks access until profile setup

**The app IS:**
- ✅ TikTok that teaches Spanish
- ✅ Entertainment app where learning happens naturally
- ✅ Works immediately with no setup
- ✅ Anonymous usage fully supported

---

## 🎯 KEY RULES FOR ALL AGENTS

1. **Default = Video feed playing immediately**
2. **No forced onboarding/placement test**
3. **All setup features = optional**
4. **Anonymous users = full functionality**
5. **Learning = side effect of watching**
