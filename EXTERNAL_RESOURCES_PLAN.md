## 📋 DECISION MATRIX: DO vs HIRE

### Always Do Yourself:
✅ Talk to users (critical founder skill)  
✅ Make product decisions (you're the visionary)  
✅ Pitch to investors (they invest in YOU)  
✅ Set company vision (leadership)  
✅ Early hiring decisions (team is everything)  

### Hire Immediately If Budget Allows:
🎨 Design (saves 20+ hours, better quality)  
📢 Growth marketing (requires expertise)  
💬 Customer support (frees your time)  
⚖️ Legal (never DIY this)  

### Can DIY If Budget Tight:
📝 Copywriting (use AI + templates)  
📊 Analytics setup (follow tutorials)  
🎥 Video editing (use Descript, Kapwing)  
📱 Basic QA (test yourself on multiple devices)  

### Never Do Yourself:
⚖️ Legal work (too risky)  
🔐 Security audit (need professional)  
📊 Financial audit (investors require CPA)  

---

## 💡 SMART BOOTSTRAPPING TACTICS

**Instead of hiring:**

- Things that take too long (customer support)
- Things that block progress (legal review)

**Don't hire for:**
- Things you can learn quickly
- Things AI can do

**Save:** $3,000-5,000

---

### Week 7-8: Spend to Close
