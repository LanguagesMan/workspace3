## =📋 COMPLETE VISION (UNTOUCHABLE - Read Only)

### Project Mission
**Create a COMPLETE feed platform with everything - articles, music, videos, transcriptions, translations - making learning Spanish and in the future all language as addictive as social media and pure entertainment. It will become their default feed for daily life. Instead of wasting time on feeds where they learn nothing**

### Target Users
- Spanish learners (A1-C2 levels)
- Ages 18-35 (Gen Z/Millennial)
- Short attention spans (TikTok generation)
- Mobile-first users

### Core Value Proposition
**"Complete immersive feed for everything - just like TikTok + Instagram + YouTube + Spotify combined, but educational."**

### Competitive Position
**We are TikTok + YouTube + Spotify + Instagram Stories**
- TikTok's addictive scroll feed with video transcriptions
- YouTube's article feed with translations
- Spotify's music feed with lyric translations
- Instagram Stories' engagement hooks
- **ALL integrated with unified word database**

### Design Philosophy
**Steal from billion-dollar apps. Never reinvent the wheel.**

Every feature must:
1. Be researched (30+ min competitive analysis)
2. Match top app quality (screenshot comparison)
3. Pass comprehensive tests (100% coverage)
4. Meet performance benchmarks (<100ms interactions)

### Tech Stack (Evidence-Based)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first like TikTok)
- **State**: Zustand (lighter than Redux)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (TikTok physics)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: AWS S3 + CDN (CloudFlare)
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E) + Jest (Unit)

### Revenue Model (Post-Launch)
