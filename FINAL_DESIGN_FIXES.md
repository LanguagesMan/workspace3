# Final Design Fixes Needed

## Current Issues (from screenshot)
1. ❌ **Duplicate stat boxes overlaying videos** - Old stats (day streak, XP, videos, badges boxes)
2. ❌ **Blue question mark** - should be white/minimalist
3. ❌ **Right sidebar buttons need repositioning** - closer to bottom for thumb access

## Fixes to Apply
1. Remove/hide the old stat card overlays
2. Change quiz button from cyan to white
3. Move right sidebar lower (currently at 522px from top - should be ~620px for thumb reach)
4. Ensure all buttons have no borders
5. Test as 3 different users

## Success Criteria
- Clean minimalist design like TikTok
- No clutter or overlays
- All controls thumb-accessible
- Professional quality matching billion-dollar apps
