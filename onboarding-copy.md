## 🎯 Success Criteria Review

**How to measure:**
- Track each screen view
- Track button clicks
- Track drop-off points
- Track time spent per screen
- Survey users who dropped off

**Optimization priorities:**
1. Reduce time to first video (<60 seconds)

3. Improve level matching accuracy
4. Reduce drop-off at tutorial screens

**Goal metrics:**
- [ ] >95% complete welcome screen
- [ ] >90% complete level selection

## 💡 Pro Tips for Implementation

1. **Keep it fast:** Every second counts. Aim for <2s per screen transition.

2. **Make it skippable:** Power users hate tutorials. Let them skip but make it easy to access help later.

3. **Personalize instantly:** Use their level selection to customize everything immediately.

4. **Celebrate small wins:** First word tapped, first word saved, first video done - celebrate everything.

5. **Don't ask for too much:** No email, no notifications, no settings until AFTER first video.

6. **Test on real devices:** Animations that work on Figma may lag on Android.

7. **Analytics everywhere:** Track every click, every drop-off, every completion.

8. **Iterate weekly:** Onboarding is never done. Always optimize.
