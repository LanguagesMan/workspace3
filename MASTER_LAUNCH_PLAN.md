## 🎯 CRITICAL PATH

### What Blocks What

**Day 1 (.env setup) BLOCKS:**
→ Database connection  
→ Server starting  
→ Feature testing  
→ Deployment  
→ Everything else  

**Week 1 (Infrastructure) ENABLES:**
→ Week 2 (Beta prep)  
→ Week 3 (Beta launch)  

**Week 4 (Beta validation) ENABLES:**
→ Week 5 (Public launch)  
→ Week 6 (Scale)  

**Week 6 (Traction) ENABLES:**
→ Week 7-8 (Fundraise)  

**The path is linear with dependencies. Cannot skip steps.**

---

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Server crashes on launch day  
**Mitigation:** Load test Week 2, use Vercel (auto-scales)  
**Owner:** You (infrastructure)  

**Risk:** Videos don't load for some users  
**Mitigation:** Test on 10 devices Week 4, CDN delivery  
**Owner:** QA Tester (Week 4)  

**Risk:** Payment system fails  
**Mitigation:** Extensive Stripe testing Week 4, test mode first  
**Owner:** You (payments)  

---

### Business Risks

**Risk:** No one signs up for beta  
**Mitigation:** Recruit from multiple channels, offer lifetime Premium  
**Owner:** You (recruitment)  

**Risk:** Low retention (<40%)  
**Mitigation:** User interviews Week 3, rapid iteration  
**Owner:** You + Designer  

**Risk:** Can't get investor meetings  
**Mitigation:** Apply to YC, cold outreach, leverage traction  
**Owner:** You (fundraising)  

---

### Resource Risks

**Risk:** Can't afford contractors  
**Mitigation:** DIY more, use free tools, find budget creatively  
**Owner:** You (budgeting)  

**Risk:** Contractor delivers poor quality  
**Mitigation:** Paid test project first, fire fast if not working  
**Owner:** You (management)
