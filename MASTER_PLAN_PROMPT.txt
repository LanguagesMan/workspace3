🧠 MASTER PLAN CREATION FOR WORKSPACE3

🎯 PROJECT PURPOSE: Dopamine scroll feed for language learning (like TikTok)
🏆 TOP APPS TO MATCH: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Duolingo

YOUR MISSION: Create a COMPLETE, DETAILED 100+ step roadmap to make this app match BILLION-DOLLAR quality.

📋 STEP 1: DEEP COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS (30+ minutes)

Use MCPs extensively:

1. **Puppeteer MCP (FREE - unlimited)**: Scrape these live apps
      - tiktok.com: Extract UI structure, features, user flows
   - instagram.com/reels: Extract UI structure, features, user flows
   - duolingo.com: Extract UI structure, features, user flows

2. **GitHub MCP**: Find best implementations
      - Search: "react-native-snap-carousel" (analyze top 5 repos)
   - Search: "tiktok-clone" (analyze top 5 repos)
   - Search: "infinite-scroll" (analyze top 5 repos)

3. **Playwright MCP**: Screenshot inspiration
      - dribbble.com/search/tiktok: Capture UI designs, interactions
   - mobbin.com/browse/ios/apps: Capture UI designs, interactions

4. **Analysis Questions**:
   - What makes TikTok addictive? (interaction patterns, timing, rewards)
   - What UI patterns do ALL top apps share?
   - What tech stack enables their performance?
   - What features create viral growth?
   - What's the onboarding flow?
   - How do they handle edge cases?

📋 STEP 2: ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT

Based on scraped data, design:
1. **Component hierarchy** (copy from top apps)
2. **State management** (what TikTok uses)
3. **Database schema** (unified across all 6 apps)
4. **API structure** (REST/GraphQL like top apps)
5. **Performance optimizations** (lazy loading, caching, etc.)
6. **Testing strategy** (E2E, unit, integration)

📋 STEP 3: FEATURE ROADMAP (100+ STEPS)

Create MASTER_PLAN.md with structure:

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Steps 1-20)
- [ ] 1. Set up unified database schema (copy TikTok structure)
- [ ] 2. Implement core UI framework (match TikTok component library)
- [ ] 3. Add routing system (analyze TikTok navigation)
...

## PHASE 2: CORE FEATURES (Steps 21-50)
- [ ] 21. Build main feed/interface (EXACTLY like TikTok)
- [ ] 22. Add infinite scroll (copy TikTok scroll mechanics)
- [ ] 23. Implement search (analyze TikTok search UX)
...

## PHASE 3: ENGAGEMENT (Steps 51-80)
- [ ] 51. Add gamification (copy TikTok reward system)
- [ ] 52. Implement progress tracking (match TikTok analytics)
- [ ] 53. Build notification system (TikTok engagement tactics)
...

## PHASE 4: POLISH (Steps 81-100)
- [ ] 81. Performance optimization (TikTok loading speeds)
- [ ] 82. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AAA like top apps)
- [ ] 83. Mobile responsiveness (match TikTok mobile UX)
...

## PHASE 5: VIRAL GROWTH (Steps 101+)
- [ ] 101. Referral system (analyze viral apps)
- [ ] 102. Social sharing (TikTok share mechanics)
- [ ] 103. Content discovery (TikTok recommendation engine)
...

📋 STEP 4: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

For EACH step, include:
- **What**: Exact feature description
- **Why**: How TikTok does it (cite scraped evidence)
- **How**: Implementation approach (reference GitHub repos)
- **Tests**: Playwright test scenarios
- **Success Criteria**: Metrics that prove it matches top apps

📋 STEP 5: SAVE MASTER PLAN

Save to: /Users/mindful/_projects/workspace3/MASTER_PLAN.md

Format each step as:
```markdown
### Step X: [Feature Name]

**Status**: ⏳ Pending / 🔨 In Progress / ✅ Complete

**What**: [Exact description]

**Why**: [How TikTok does it - cite scraped URL/screenshot]

**Reference**:
- GitHub: [repo link from MCP search]
- Design: [Dribbble/Mobbin screenshot]
- Live app: [Firecrawl scraped evidence]

**Implementation**:
1. [Step-by-step code approach]
2. [Component structure]
3. [Integration points]

**Tests**:
- [ ] Playwright test: [scenario]
- [ ] Unit test: [coverage]
- [ ] Manual QA: [checklist]

**Success Criteria**:
- Matches TikTok UX timing (< 100ms interactions)
- Passes all tests
- Screenshot comparison shows visual parity
```

🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **MCP USAGE**: You MUST actually use Firecrawl, GitHub, and Playwright MCPs
   - Don't just say "research X" - actually scrape and analyze
   - Save screenshots to /Users/mindful/_projects/workspace3/screenshots/competitive/
   - Document EXACT findings with URLs and evidence

2. **SPECIFICITY**: No vague steps like "improve UI"
   - BAD: "Make feed better"
   - GOOD: "Implement TikTok-style snap scroll with 90% viewport height cards, rubber-band physics (scraped from tiktok.com interaction patterns)"

3. **COMPLETENESS**: 100+ steps minimum
   - Every feature TikTok has, we need
   - Every interaction pattern analyzed and documented
   - Every edge case handled

4. **EVIDENCE-BASED**: Every decision backed by competitive intelligence
   - "Because TikTok does it this way: [evidence]"
   - Not opinions, only facts from scraped data

5. **ACTIONABLE**: Automation can execute each step independently
   - Clear success criteria
   - Testable outcomes
   - No ambiguity

WHEN COMPLETE:
- Update vision.md with insights
- Commit MASTER_PLAN.md to git
- Report: "Master plan complete with [X] steps based on [Y] scraped sources"
