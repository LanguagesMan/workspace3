## 🧠 The Genius Auto-Detection (`~/.cursorrules`)

Cursor now **automatically** knows when to use each MCP based on what you say:

### Auto-Detection Rules:

| You Say | Cursor Detects | Auto-Uses | Result |
|---------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| "test the app" | "test" keyword | 🎭 Playwright | Screenshots on mobile + desktop |
| "How does TikTok..." | "TikTok" + question | 🤖 Puppeteer | Scrapes and extracts code |
| "optimize performance" | "optimize" keyword | 🧠 Sequential-thinking | Plans approach systematically |
| "check API" | "API" keyword | 🌐 Fetch | Tests endpoints |
| "create PR" | "PR" keyword | 🐙 GitHub | Creates pull request |

**You never need to mention MCP names!**

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Restart Cursor
Close Cursor completely and reopen to load the config.

### Step 2: Talk Naturally
Just describe what you want:

```
"Test the video feed on iPhone"
"How does Instagram handle Reels swipe?"
"Optimize the loading performance"
"Scrape Duolingo's gamification UI"
"Check if the API is working"
```

### Step 3: Watch Magic Happen
Cursor will automatically:
- Detect keywords in your message
- Select the right MCP(s)
- Execute the task
- Collect evidence (screenshots, code, reports)
- Present results

---

## 💡 Quick Examples

### Example 1: Instant Testing
**You:** "Test on mobile"
**Cursor:** *Auto-launches Playwright, tests on iPhone 14 Pro, captures screenshots*
**Time:** 10 seconds
**Output:** `screenshots/test-[timestamp]/iphone14pro.png`

### Example 2: Competitor Research
**You:** "How does TikTok implement scroll?"
**Cursor:** *Auto-launches Puppeteer, scrapes TikTok, extracts code*
**Time:** 15 seconds
**Output:** `research-data/tiktok/[timestamp]/` with HTML + CSS + JS

### Example 3: Complex Task
**You:** "Implement swipe gestures like Instagram"
**Cursor:** *Auto plans with sequential-thinking → scrapes Instagram with Puppeteer → implements → tests with Playwright*
**Time:** 30 seconds
**Output:** Complete implementation with evidence
