## 2. Waitlist Email (Day 13)

**Subject:** Thanks for applying to Langflix Beta

**To:** Non-selected applicants

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for applying to the Langflix beta program!

I had [NUMBER] applications for just 100 spots, so it was tough to narrow down. Unfortunately, you weren't selected for this round—but I'd love to keep you on the **waitlist**.

**Why you're on the waitlist:**

If any of our beta users drop out (which sometimes happens), I'll invite people from the waitlist. You'd still get lifetime Premium access.

**What happens next:**

- Public launch is in 3-4 weeks (Week 5)
- You'll get **early access** (1 week before general public)
- As a thank-you for applying, you'll get **3 months free** Premium

I'll email you when we're ready to launch. Thanks for your interest in Langflix!

Best,
[Your name]
Founder, Langflix

Hi [Name],

I've noticed you've been using Langflix consistently (thank you!!) and I wanted to ask for a small favor.

3. What you think of Langflix (be honest!)
4. Who should try it

**How to record:**
- Use your phone camera (vertical or horizontal, whatever)
- Find good lighting (near a window is great)
- Keep it casual—no need to be perfect!
- 30-60 seconds max

**Upload here:** [UPLOAD LINK or email instructions]

**What you get:**
- Featured in our launch announcement (if you want)
- Major thank-you from me
- Eternal gratitude 🙏

No pressure if you're not comfortable on camera! You're already helping a ton by using the app and giving feedback.

Thanks for considering!
