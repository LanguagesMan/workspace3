🚀 BETA TESTERS WANTED: Spanish Learning App (100 spots)

Hey everyone! I've spent the last 6 months building Langflix, a new way

Duolingo).

What it does:

• Tap any word to translate instantly
• AI conversation partner (voice or text)
• Spaced repetition for words you save
• Personalized feed based on your level

I need 100 beta testers to help me:
- Find bugs
- Test features
- Give honest feedback
- Shape the product before launch

In exchange:
✨ Free Premium access for LIFE (normally $4.99/month)
✨ Direct access to me (the founder)
✨ Early influence on product direction

Beta runs for 2 weeks. I'll ask you to:
- Use the app
- Fill out short daily surveys (2 min)
- Be honest about what sucks

If you're learning Spanish (any level) and want to help build something 
cool, apply here: [Google Form Link]

### Version 3: Personal Story

```
🎓 I built a Spanish learning app because I was frustrated with Duolingo

Like many of you, I tried every app: Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone. 
They all felt like school. Boring lessons, fake dialogues, cartoon characters.

What actually helped me? Watching Spanish content on Netflix and TikTok.

So I built Langflix: a language learning app that uses REAL video content.

825+ clips from movies, shows, and street interviews. Tap any word to 
translate. Save words you want to remember. Practice with an AI chat partner.

I'm launching in 3 weeks and need 100 beta testers.

What I'm offering:
• Free Premium access for LIFE
• A chance to shape the product
• Direct access to me (the founder)

What I need from you:
• Use it for 2 weeks
• Tell me what's broken
• Fill out short daily surveys
• Be brutally honest

Any Spanish level welcome (A1 to C2). iOS and Android.

Apply: [Google Form Link]

P.S. I'm only taking 100 people, so apply soon if interested!
