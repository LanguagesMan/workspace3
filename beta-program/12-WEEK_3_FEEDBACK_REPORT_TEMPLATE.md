## Executive Summary

[3-4 sentences summarizing Week 3 insights]

Example:
> Week 3 showed strong retention with 58% of Day 1 users still active. We completed 10 user interviews revealing that tap-to-translate is our killer feature, but the AI chat needs significant UX improvements. The top feature request is offline mode. Users are willing to pay $4.99/month if we add more beginner content and fix remaining bugs.
