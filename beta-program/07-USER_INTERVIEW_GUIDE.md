## Interview Best Practices

### DO:
✅ **Listen more than you talk** (80/20 rule)
✅ **Ask "why?"** multiple times to get to the root
✅ **Let silence happen** (people fill it with insights)
✅ **Ask for specific examples** ("Tell me about a time when...")
✅ **Probe deeper** ("What do you mean by that?")
✅ **Stay neutral** (don't defend your product)
✅ **Take notes** (even if recording)
✅ **Thank them sincerely**

### DON'T:
❌ **Lead the witness** ("Don't you think the videos are great?")
❌ **Get defensive** ("But that feature is supposed to work like...")
❌ **Talk about future features** (you're learning, not pitching)
❌ **Rush through questions** (let the conversation flow)
❌ **Interview friends/family** (they're too biased)
❌ **Skip the tough questions** (pricing, churn, comparison)
❌ **Forget the gift card** (send within 24 hours!)

## Red Flags to Listen For

🚨 **"It's fine"** = It's not fine, dig deeper

🚨 **"I don't know"** = They know, they're just uncomfortable saying

🚨 **Vague complaints** = Ask for specific examples

🚨 **Too positive** = They're being polite, not honest

🚨 **"Maybe I'd pay"** = Probably won't pay

🚨 **Confusion about core features** = Onboarding problem

🚨 **Comparing to free apps** = Pricing will be hard
