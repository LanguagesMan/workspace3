## What We're Asking From You

### 1. Expect Bugs 🐛
This is a beta. Things will break. Features might not work perfectly. We're counting on your patience and understanding.

**Examples of what might happen:**
- Videos might not load occasionally
- Translations might be slow
- The AI chat might give weird responses
- Your progress might not save properly
- The app might crash

**What we need from you:**
- Don't get discouraged! Report bugs and we'll fix them fast.
- Include screenshots when possible
- Tell us what you were doing when the bug happened

---

### 2. Provide Honest Feedback 💬
We need your brutal honesty. Tell us what sucks. Tell us what's confusing. Tell us what you love.

**We'll ask you to:**
- Fill out a **daily 2-minute survey** (sent at 8pm)
- Share what's working and what's not
- Be specific (not just "it's good" or "it's bad")

**Good feedback examples:**
- ❌ "The app is confusing"
- ✅ "I couldn't figure out how to save a word. I tapped everywhere but nothing happened."

- ❌ "I love it!"
- ✅ "I love that I can tap any word to translate it. It's way faster than looking things up."

---

### 3. Daily Check-Ins 📊
We'll send you a **2-minute survey every evening** for the first 2 weeks. Please fill it out!

**Why this matters:**
- Helps us understand what's working
- Lets us catch problems early
- Shows us usage patterns

**Survey schedule:**
- Sent daily at 8pm (your timezone)
- Takes 2 minutes max
- 7 simple questions

**If you can't do daily check-ins:**
- No problem! But please do at least 3-4 per week
- The more feedback, the better the product

---

### 4. 30-Minute Interview Availability 🎤
We'd love to interview **at least 20 of the 100 beta users**. If selected:

- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Format:** Video call (Zoom/Google Meet)
- **When:** Week 2-3 of beta
- **Purpose:** Deep dive into your experience

**Interview topics:**
- Your first impressions
- What's confusing vs. what's intuitive
- How Langflix compares to other apps
- Whether you'd pay for it (and how much)
- What features are missing

**What you get:**
- $25 Amazon gift card as a thank-you
- Extra influence on product direction
- A chance to be featured in our launch story

---

### 5. Respect the NDA 🤐
Langflix is not publicly launched yet. Please:

**DO:**
- ✅ Tell friends/family: "I'm testing a cool new Spanish app"
- ✅ Share general feedback in our private Discord
- ✅ Post testimonials when we ask (Week 3-4)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Post screenshots publicly on social media
- ❌ Write public reviews on Reddit/Twitter before launch
- ❌ Share your beta code with others (it's unique to you)

**After launch (Week 5):** You can share anything you want!

---

## What Happens If You Stop Using It?

We get it—life happens. If you decide Langflix isn't for you:

1. **Please tell us why** (1-minute exit survey)
2. You keep your **lifetime Premium access** anyway
3. No hard feelings!

We'd rather know what went wrong than have you ghost us. Your honest feedback—even if negative—is incredibly valuable.
