## ❓ FAQ Section

### Question 1: What level is this for?
**Answer:** Langflix works for all levels (A1-C2). Our algorithm recommends videos based on your current level. Beginners start with simple videos, advanced learners get complex content.

### Question 2: How much does it cost?
**Answer:** $4.99/month with a 7-day free trial. No credit card required for trial. Cancel anytime with one click.

### Question 3: Can I really cancel anytime?
**Answer:** Yes! No contracts, no commitments. Cancel from your account settings in 30 seconds.

### Question 4: What makes Langflix different from Duolingo?
**Answer:** Duolingo uses artificial exercises. Langflix uses real videos. Instead of translating "The turtle eats apples," you're learning from actual Spanish content. Plus, TikTok-style UX makes it addictive.

### Question 5: Do I need to know any Spanish to start?
**Answer:** Nope! Complete beginners start with A1 videos (simple phrases, common words). You'll be surprised how fast you pick it up.

### Question 6: What languages do you support?
**Answer:** Currently Spanish only. We're focused on making the best Spanish learning app first. More languages coming in 2026.

### Question 7: Does this work on mobile?
**Answer:** Yes! iOS and Android apps coming soon. Web version works perfectly on mobile browsers right now.

### Question 8: How is the AI conversation partner different?
**Answer:** Unlike generic AI, our chat uses YOUR saved vocabulary. If you learned "biblioteca" (library) from a video, the AI will use it in conversation. Personalized practice.
