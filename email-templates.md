### Email Body

**Subject:** 3 tips to master Spanish faster ⚡

Hey [First Name],

You've been using Langflix for 3 days now. Here's what I wish someone told me when I started learning Spanish:

**Tip #1: Watch Daily (Even Just 5 Minutes)** 🗓️

You don't need hour-long study sessions. Just ONE video a day builds the habit. Your brain needs consistent exposure, not marathon cramming.

Your current streak: **[X days]** 🔥
Keep it going!

[Watch Today's Video →]

**Tip #2: Save Words You Actually Want to Use** 💾

Don't save every word. Save words you'd actually use in conversation. Going to a restaurant? Save food words. Planning travel? Save direction words.

You've saved **[X words]** so far. Nice!

**Tip #3: Review Your Saved Words** 🧠

This is the secret sauce. Our spaced repetition system shows you words right before you forget them. Just 2 minutes of daily review = permanent vocabulary.

[Review Your Words →]

**Bonus Tip:** Talk to yourself in Spanish. Sounds weird, but narrating your day in Spanish (even badly) accelerates learning like crazy.

Keep crushing it!

The Langflix Team

P.S. You've watched **[X videos]** and learned **[X words]** in 3 days. At this rate, you'll know 500+ words in 3 months. 📈

**Evening (5 minutes):**
- Watched 1 more video
- 2-minute AI conversation using her saved words

**Total:** 12 minutes per day
**Result:** 100 words in 14 days

**Her Secret?**

"I didn't study. I just made it part of my routine. Coffee = Spanish video. Easy."

**Your Progress So Far:**

You've learned **[X words]** in 14 days. You're [ahead/on track/behind] Maria's pace!

Keep going!
