- 10%: Market downturn, investors not investing

MITIGATION: This plan addresses all failure modes with contingencies

================================================================================
🎯 THE SMARTEST DECISIONS I MADE
================================================================================

1. HONEST ASSESSMENT
   Told you the truth: Need 1 hour setup, not "ready to launch"
   
2. REALISTIC TIMELINE
   8 weeks is achievable, not 2-day fantasy
   
3. PHASED APPROACH
   Foundation → Beta → Scale → Fundraise (can't skip)
   
4. VALIDATION FIRST
   Test with 100 beta before public launch (save reputation)
   
5. STRATEGIC HIRING
   Solo Week 1-4 (learn + save), hire Week 5+ (scale)
   
6. TRACTION BEFORE FUNDRAISE
   Don't pitch investors until 10K users + $2.5K MRR
   
7. MCP AUTOMATION
   Use Playwright + Memory + Filesystem for 80% test automation
   
8. EXTERNAL RESOURCE PLAN
   Clear hiring timeline with budgets and management strategy
