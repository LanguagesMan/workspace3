## CURRENT PRIORITY: Expand Beyond GLOBO to Golden Standards Content

**Focus automation on:**
- Creating golden standard viral Spanish videos with objects doing funny things
- Historical figures vlogging content (always with funny elements)
- Expanding beyond just GLOBO character to diverse funny content types
- Making every video have a really funny element that drives virality

**Avoid:**
- Don't focus only on GLOBO character anymore
- Don't lose the humor element - comedy is core to virality
- Don't break the TikTok-style short format
- Don't make content that isn't immediately funny/engaging

**Success metrics:**
- Diverse content types beyond GLOBO (objects, historical figures, etc.)
- Every video has a clear funny hook within first 3 seconds
- Spanish learning happens naturally through funny scenarios
- Content feels genuinely viral and shareable

**Status:** AUTO-CONFIGURED - Ready for automation
